ABOUT ME: 
My name is Andrea and I am currently a Real Estate Data Analyst at UnitedHealth Group. In my role, I frequently use Python, Excel, Power BI, Tableau, and ArcGIS to tell stories with data. I am passionate about leveraging data to make more informed decisions, especially when it comes to spatial analysis. 

BACKGROUND:
I graduated from Lawrence University with a Mathematics-Economics major and Data Science Minor. Throughout college, I served as a tutor for both the Statistics and Economics departments. I also completed an independent study under my professor in which I developed R Shiny Apps for use in introductory statistics courses. These interactive dashboards helped students visualize various statistical concepts like sampling methods and confidence intervals. 

Beyond tutoring, I interned at an environmental economics consultancy called TBD Economics, where I conducted literature reviews and reserach on sustainable fishing methods. I also worked Blue Moon Emporium, a gift shop which sells Wisconsin-themed products, ranging from dish towels to prints, from local artists.

INTERESTS:
In my free time, I love to stay busy! I enjoy spending time outside, mainly while running or doing yoga. I also adore reading and doing crosswords. I love connecting with my creative side through drawing, bullet journaling, and sewing. 

I am a cellist! I currently play with the Linden Hills Community Orchestra. Recently, I have been working on Apres un Reve (Gabriel Faure), Julie-O (Mark Summer), and Meditation (Jules Massenet).
