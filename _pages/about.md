My name is Andrea and I am currently a senior at Lawrence University pursuing a Mathematics-Economics major and Data Science Minor. I am passionate about using data to make meaningful contributions! 

On campus, I serve as a tutor for both the Economics and Statistics departments. I hold weekly group sessions in addition to individual sessions. Furthermore, I recently starting working with my professor to develop materials for the introductory statistics courses. Through this project, I have been making interative graphcis using R Shiny Apps to facilitate active learning. 

I am involved in a couple of extracuricular activities on campus. I am a board member for the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM). I help plan events and create all marketing materials. I also participate in the Data Science Club on campus, where I have had the opportunity to refine my skillset and compete in the Datathon competition. 

I am also a cellist! I am participate in a non-major cello ensemble on campus in addition to taking lessons. Recently, I have been working on Apres un Reve (Gabriel Faure), Julie-O (Mark Summer), and Meditation (Jules Massenet). 

In my free time, I love to stay busy! I love spending time outside, mainly while running or doing yoga. I also enjoy reading, doing crossword puzzles, and making art.
