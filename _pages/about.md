My name is Andrea and I am currently a senior at Lawrence University pursuing a Mathematics-Economics major and Data Science Minor. I am passionate about using data to make meaningful contributions! 

On campus, I serve as a tutor for both the Economics and Statistics departments. I hold weekly group sessions in addition to individual sessions. Furthermore, I recently starting working with my professor to develop materials for the introductory statistics courses. Through this project, I have been making interactive graphics using R Shiny Apps to facilitate active learning. 

I am involved in a couple of extracuricular activities on campus. I am a board member for the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM). I help plan events and create all marketing materials. I also participate in the Data Science Club on campus, where I have had the opportunity to refine my skillset and compete in the Datathon competition. 

I also work at a gift shop called Blue Moon Emporium. We sell locally made artwork and gifts like prints, ceramics, and more. In addition to customer service responsibilities, I assist in making our in-house products, performing tasks such as branding t-shirts and tagging items. 

I recently started an internship with TBD Economics, an environmental economics consultancy. I contribute by reviewing relevant literature and I will soon have the opportunity to complete data analysis and map creation. 

I am also a cellist! I am participate in a non-major cello ensemble on campus in addition to taking lessons. Recently, I have been working on Apres un Reve (Gabriel Faure), Julie-O (Mark Summer), and Meditation (Jules Massenet). 

In my free time, I love to stay busy! I love spending time outside, mainly while running or doing yoga. I also enjoy reading and doing crosswords. I love connecting with my creative side through drawing, bullet journaling, and sewing.
